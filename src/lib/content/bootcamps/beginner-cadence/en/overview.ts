				question: 'üìñ What is this bootcamp?',
				answer:
					'Learn Cadence. You will explore ALL of the major aspects of the language.<br/><br/>In addition to writing & deploying your own NFT Contract during the bootcamp, you will have the knowledge to write your own contracts too.'
			},
			{
				question: 'üöÄ What will I know by the end?',
				answer:
					'<ul><li>All of the major concepts of Cadence</li><li>The ability to write your own smart contracts in Cadence</li><li>The ability to create most (non-advanced) Cadence contracts</li><li>You will have created an NFT Contract during the bootcamp</li><li>How to deploy a contract to Flow Testnet</li></ul>'
			},
			{
				question: 'üîñ What will I create?',
				answer:
					'You will create your own NFT smart contract deployed to Flow Testnet. You can see an example of that <a href="https://flow-view-source.com/testnet/account/0xfa88aefbb588049d/contract/YoungJacob" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>However, the foundational skills you learn will allow you to make much more than that.'
			},
			{
				question: 'üòá Who is this bootcamp meant for?',
				answer:
					"<ul><li>If you've never coded Cadence before</li><li>If you have coded in Cadence but want to refresh up on some of the concepts</li><li>If you're interested in the language and want to know more</li></ul>"
			},
			{
				question: 'üìö How does it work?',
				answer:
					"The lessons will be split into 'chapters,' and chapters will be split into 'lessons.' I did it this way so you can manage your time and progress through the bootcamp as you like. Do not feel pressured to do this every lesson. Do it at your own pace and have fun with it! It will always be here :)<br/><br/>Here's an overview:<ul><li>Lessons split into lessons</li><li>Written & video content associated with each lesson. The videos will be from my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf6DzMRwj7SJ3nPrZqd5hHw' target='_blank'>YouTube Channel</a>.</li><li>Quests to complete</li><li>Short quizzes</li><li>A completion certificate (<a href='https://floats.city/jacob.find/event/241503135' target='_blank'>this FLOAT</a>) if you have completed all the quests from Chapters 1-5 (Chapter 6 is extra credit). This will be proof that you have significant Cadence knowledge, and you will be able to show it to whoever you like as proof of expertise. Or just for fun! :D</li></ul>"
			},
			{
				question: '‚ùì What do I need ahead of time?',
				answer:
					'Nothing.<br/><br/>In order to complete this bootcamp, you need to know absolutely nothing about coding. I included Chapter 1.5 that teaches you the basics of computer programming.<br/><br/><i>Although Chapter 1.5 is a great introduction to programming, if you have never written code before, you may also want to do some outside learning before this bootcamp, because it can get complicated very quick. I would suggest some intro to Javascript tutorials to teach you some foundational elements of programming.<br/><br/>It is impossible to learn how to code by watching tutorials/reading articles. You must mess up on your own to make true progress.</i>'
			},
			{
				question: 'üìÅ What are quests?',
				answer:
					"Quests are like homework assignments. There are quests for every lesson of content. They will test your understanding of the concepts that are in that lesson's content."
			},
			{
				question: 'üôã How do I submit quests?',
				answer:
					'When you finish a quest, please store all your quests together. Then, when you want them to be reviewed, submit them in the #quest-submissions channel inside the <a href="https://discord.gg/emerald-city-906264258189332541" target="_blank">Emerald City Discord</a> and our instructors will review them.'
			},
			{
				question: 'üìù What are quizzes?',
				answer:
					"Every lesson also has a quiz associated with it to test your knowledge. It is a simple Google Form you can fill out to test your understanding for that lesson's content.<br/><br/><i>All of these quizzes are entirely thanks to FrankenSense. Thank you for being an absolute legend!</i>"
