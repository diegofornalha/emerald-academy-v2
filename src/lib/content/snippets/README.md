# How to Add a Snippet

Hello! Thank you for being interested in helping out the developer community by adding a new snippet!

Here are the steps to add a snippet:

1. Create a folder with the name being the title of your snippet. Just look at how the others are done.
2. In the folder, you should have the following files:
- `overview.ts` - follow the format like the others. 
    - For the `codeLink`, this should be a link to a working example where the student can easily test the specific code you're teaching. There should be no other code included.
- `readme.md` - what will display on the snippet page. 
    - Make sure to include...
        ```md
        ---
        layout: examples
        ---
        ```

        ...at the top.
