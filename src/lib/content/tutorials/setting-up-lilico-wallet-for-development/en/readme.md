# Chapter 1 Lesson 1 - Download & Setup Lilico Wallet

When testing your DApps on the Flow testnet, it's important to ensure you have a wallet capable of supporting multiple accounts and that those accounts have been funded. Unfunded testnet accounts will often run into storage capacity errors when attempting to interact with the blockchain.

## Download Lilico Wallet

Start by downloading [Lilico](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lilico/id1644169603) from the App Store.

## Open & Create Account

After Lilico finishes downloading, open the app and press Skip to continue past the info pages. After that you will need to accept the Legal Information, then pick your username.

## Setup Developer Mode

Once your account has been created, we need to enable Developer Mode to access our testnet account. Head to the "Settings" tab (it's the 'profile' icon in the bottom right corner of the screen) then click on "Developer Mode". On the next screen press the toggle to enable Developer Mode and select "Testnet". You can now navigate back to the main account page, once there you should see a green "TESTNET" badge next to your account name in the upper right corner of the screen.

To switch accounts or create additional accounts simply click on your profile image in the upper right hand corner of the main account page. From this screen you can select which wallet you wish to use or press the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner to switch/create accounts. The process of creating additional accounts is the same as above.
