## üö© Quickstart 0: Hello World

üé´ Deploy a simple HelloWorld contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:

- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts.
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template SvelteKit app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

üåü The final deliverable is a DApp that lets users read and change a greeting field on Flow Testnet.

## üì¶ Checkpoint 0: Install

Required:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/) - you know you have installed it if you type `flow version` in your terminal and it prints a version.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emerald-dao/0-hello-world-svelte.git
```

First, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`

Then, in a terminal window, install the dependencies and start your frontend:

```sh
cd 0-hello-world-svelte
npm install
npm run dev
```

In a second terminal window, start your local emulator:

```bash
cd 0-hello-world-svelte
flow emulator start -v
```

_Note: the `-v` flag means to print transaction and script output to your local emulator_

In a third terminal window, deploy your contract and start your local wallet:

```bash
cd 0-hello-world-svelte
flow project deploy
flow dev-wallet
```

You can run `flow project deploy --update` to deploy a new contract or update your existing `HelloWorld` contract any time.

## üëõ Checkpoint 1: Wallets

We'll be using **the local Flow dev wallet**.

Click the "Connect" button and notice a window appears with different accounts to select, each with their own Flow Token balance. Select the first account to log in to it.

## üìò Checkpoint 2: Reading the Greeting

Click the `Get greeting` button to see your greeting:

## ‚úèÔ∏è Checkpoint 3: Changing the Greeting

Change the greeting! Type a new greeting into the input.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7MnrBGO.png" alt="changing the greeting" />

Then, click the `Change greeting` button. You should see a transaction pop up:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PMPzs15.png" alt="transaction popup" />

Click "APPROVE" and then click the `Get greeting` button again. You should now see your new greeting.

## üîê Checkpoint 4: Create a Testnet Account

Create a new account by opening up a terminal in the same directory as your project and typing `flow accounts create`. 
- Name: `testnet-account`
- Network: `Testnet`

Open up your flow.json file and you should see under the "accounts" object that it automatically configured a testnet-account for you.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure `testnet-account.pkey` is inside your .gitignore. You never want to commit private keys to git!

## üíæ Checkpoint 5: Deploy to Testnet!

We will now deploy our contracts to the account we just created.

In your flow.json file, under the "deployments" object, add the following:

```json
"testnet": {
  "testnet-account": [
    "HelloWorld"
  ]
}
```

Then, under the "contracts" object, find the "HelloWorld" object and add a new testnet alias. The address you put should be the same one that was added to your flow.json automatically under the "testnet-account" object:

```json
"HelloWorld": {
  "source": "./src/lib/flow/cadence/contracts/HelloWorld.cdc",
  "aliases": {
    "emulator": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
    "testnet": "5f4ea4877f5afeab"
  }
}
```

Your final flow.json should look something like this:

```json

	"contracts": {
		"FIND": {

	"deployments": {

		},

	}
}
```

üöÄ Deploy your HelloWorld smart contract:

```sh
flow project deploy --network=testnet
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GBFs2Uz.png" alt="deploy contract to testnet" />

In your .env file, change the following:

1. `PUBLIC_FLOW_NETWORK=testnet`

You can now stop all your terminals since we no longer need to run our own local blockchain or wallet. Everything lives on testnet!

Run `npm run dev` to start your application in a terminal, and have a blast with your DApp!

## üìù Make Edits!

üîè You can check out your smart contract `HelloWorld.cdc`, transactions and scripts in `src/lib/flow/cadence`.

üíº Look at how FCL runs your transactions or scripts in `src/lib/flow/actions`.

üìù If you want to make frontend edits, open `+page.svelte` in `src/routes/+page.svelte`.
