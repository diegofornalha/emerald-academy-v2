Do not feel pressured to do this every lesson. Do it at your own pace and have fun with it! It will always be here :)<br/><br/>Here's an overview:<ul><li>Lessons split into lessons</li><li>Written & video content associated with each lesson. The videos will be from my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf6DzMRwj7SJ3nPrZqd5hHw' target='_blank'>YouTube Channel</a>.</li><li>Quests to complete</li><li>Short quizzes</li><li>A completion certificate (<a href='https://floats.city/jacob.find/event/241503135' target='_blank'>this FLOAT</a>) if you have completed all the quests from Chapters 1-5 (Chapter 6 is extra credit). This will be proof that you have significant Cadence knowledge, and you will be able to show it to whoever you like as proof of expertise. Or just for fun! :D</li></ul>"
